<h1 class="A1">CSS can be to added HTML documents in 3 ways</h1>
<div class="E5">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Inline- by using the style attribute in HTML elements1
        </li>
        <li>
            Internal - by using a style element in a head section
        </li>
        <li>
            External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.
        </li>
        <li>
            The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span class="D4"><strong>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</strong></span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.
        </li>
    </ul>

    When comparing CSS Class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
</p>
<p class="F6">
    In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an elements has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
</p>
<p class="F6">
    There is a wide range of selectors availabe. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to get elements to which style should be applied.
